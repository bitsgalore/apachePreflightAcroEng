# Apache Preflight analysis Adobe Acrobat Engineering PDFs

## Contents of this repo
This repo contains output files of Apache Preflight 2.0.0 (part of the [PDFBox](http://pdfbox.apache.org/) library) for a selection of the test PDFs on [Adobe's Acrobat Engineering website](http://acroeng.adobe.com/wp/). The following files were analysed:

1. all files in the *General* section of the [Font Testing](http://acroeng.adobe.com/wp/?page_id=101) category;
2. all files in the *Classic Multimedia* section of the [Multimedia & 3D Tests](http://acroeng.adobe.com/wp/?page_id=61) category (and a couple of files in the *3D* section as well).

Results obtained using Apache Prelight version 2.0.0.

For a discussion of these results, see this blog post:

**Note:** The PDFs were also analysed using the Preflight module of Adobe Acrobat, but the analysis results (which are in PDF format) include the content of the source files. However, the Acrobat Engineering website doesn't specify under which license these files are published, so for legal reasons they are not included here.
